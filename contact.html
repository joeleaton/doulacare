          <h1>Get in Touch</h1>

          <p class="lead">I'd love to hear from you! Whether you have questions about doula services, want to book a free consultation, or simply want to chat about your upcoming birth, please reach out.</p>

          <h2>Free Consultation</h2>

          <p>I offer a <strong>free, no-obligation consultation</strong> where we can:</p>

          <ul class="custom-list">
            <li>Discuss your needs and expectations</li>
            <li>Answer all your questions about doula support</li>
            <li>Explore which services might be right for you</li>
            <li>Get to know each other and see if we're a good fit</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The consultation can be in person at your home, via video call, or over the phone—whatever works best for you.</p>

          <h2>Response Time</h2>

          <p>I aim to respond to all enquiries within <strong>24 hours</strong>. If you don't hear back from me, please try calling as emails can occasionally go to spam folders.</p>

          <p>If you're currently in labour or have an urgent need, please <strong>call me directly</strong> rather than emailing.</p>

          <h2>What to Expect</h2>

          <p>When you contact me, we'll arrange a time for your free consultation. There's no pressure—this is simply an opportunity for us to meet, for you to ask questions, and for both of us to determine if we're the right match for your birth journey.</p>

          <p>Many families find it helpful to interview multiple doulas before making their decision, and I completely support that approach. Finding the right doula is about compatibility, trust, and feeling comfortable.</p>

          <blockquote class="testimonial">
            <p>"I would have a doula for my next birth as I would like to feel safe again, like I had a 'sane' brain by my side who knows what kind of labour I want and can help me achieve it."</p>
            <cite class="testimonial-author">— Sarah</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote class="testimonial">
            <p>"I don't know how I would have managed without my lovely doula, Laureen. She just got on with everything and was really helpful yet not intrusive during the birth. She was calm and sanguine and a Godsend after the birth."</p>
