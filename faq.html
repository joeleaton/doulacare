            What exactly does a doula do?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A doula provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support to you and your partner before, during, and after birth. I help with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Physical comfort:</strong> Massage, positioning, breathing techniques, use of birth ball, rebozo, TENS machine, etc.</li>
              <li><strong>Emotional support:</strong> Encouragement, reassurance, a calm presence, and helping you feel safe and confident</li>
              <li><strong>Information:</strong> Explaining what's happening, discussing your options, helping you make informed decisions</li>
              <li><strong>Partner support:</strong> Showing your partner how they can help, allowing them breaks, reducing their stress</li>
              <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Ensuring your wishes are heard and respected</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unlike midwives who provide medical care, doulas focus entirely on your wellbeing and experience. We don't perform medical tasks - we're there for YOU.</p>

            What's the difference between a doula and a midwife?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Midwives</strong> provide medical care. They:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Monitor your baby's heartbeat</li>
              <li>Check your blood pressure and vitals</li>
              <li>Perform vaginal examinations</li>
              <li>Deliver your baby</li>
              <li>Handle medical interventions if needed</li>
              <li>Care for multiple women during their shift</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Doulas</strong> provide non-medical support. We:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Stay with YOU continuously throughout labour</li>
              <li>Focus on your comfort and emotional needs</li>
              <li>Never leave your side for shift changes</li>
              <li>Provide techniques for coping with contractions</li>
              <li>Support your birth partner</li>
              <li>Help you understand your options</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We work together as a team! You need a midwife for medical care, and a doula for continuous personal support. Think of it this way: the midwife cares for your body and baby, while the doula cares for your experience and emotions.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
            Do I need a doula if I have a partner?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Absolutely! Your partner is irreplaceable - they love you and you love them. But labour is a unique and intense experience, and your partner may:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Feel uncertain about how to help</li>
              <li>Not know effective comfort techniques</li>
              <li>Feel stressed or overwhelmed themselves</li>
              <li>Need breaks for food, rest, or bathroom</li>
              <li>Want support and guidance too</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With a doula, I:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Show your partner effective massage and positioning techniques</li>
              <li>Explain what's happening so they understand the process</li>
              <li>Allow them to take breaks without you being alone</li>
              <li>Support them emotionally too</li>
              <li>Help them feel confident and involved</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many partners tell me that having a doula allowed them to be more present and enjoy the birth rather than feeling stressed or helpless. Instead of replacing your partner, I empower them to support you better!</p>

            <p>No, never! Your birth, your choices. My role is to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide information about your options</li>
              <li>Help you understand what healthcare providers are suggesting</li>
              <li>Ensure you have time to ask questions</li>
              <li>Support whatever decisions YOU make</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm here to ensure you feel informed and empowered to make your own choices. Whether you want an epidural, a home birth, a caesarean, or anything else - I support YOU and your decisions without judgment.</p>

            Do doulas only support natural births?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Not at all! I support ALL types of births:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Epidural births:</strong> I help with positioning, provide emotional support, and assist with comfort until you get your epidural</li>
              <li><strong>Inductions:</strong> I help you stay comfortable during the induction process</li>
              <li><strong>Caesareans:</strong> I can be with you in theatre (if hospital allows), help with early breastfeeding, and provide emotional support</li>
              <li><strong>Home births:</strong> I have extensive home birth experience and can provide a birth pool</li>
              <li><strong>Water births:</strong> In hospital or at home</li>
              <li><strong>VBACs:</strong> Special support for vaginal birth after caesarean</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Ideal timing:</strong> Second trimester (around 20-28 weeks) gives us plenty of time to build our relationship and ensures I'm available.</p>
            <p><strong>But don't worry if you're further along!</strong> I've supported families who contacted me:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In their third trimester</li>
              <li>Just weeks before their due date</li>
              <li>Even in early labour!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you're interested in doula support, reach out regardless of how far along you are. The worst I can say is that I'm already booked, but I may know other excellent doulas who are available.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes! The initial consultation is completely free with no obligation. This gives us a chance to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Meet each other and see if we're a good fit</li>
              <li>Discuss your hopes and concerns about birth</li>

            Are you on call 24/7 from 37 weeks?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes! From 37 weeks until your baby is born, I'm on call for you day and night. This means:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>My phone is always on and within reach</li>
              <li>I can be contacted anytime, any day</li>
              <li>I stay within reasonable distance of your area</li>
              <li>I don't travel far or take holidays</li>
              <li>I'm ready to come when you need me</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can call or text me when contractions start, if your waters break, or if you just need reassurance. I'll talk you through early labour and let you know when I should come.</p>

            What if I go into labour when you're with another client?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>This is rare because I carefully limit the number of clients I take each month to avoid due date overlaps. However, if it happens:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I have a backup doula who knows your birth plan</li>
              <li>You'll meet them during pregnancy</li>
              <li>They're highly experienced and qualified</li>
              <li>I'll join you as soon as I'm able</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In over 10 years, I've rarely had to use a backup, but it's important to have this safety net for your peace of mind.</p>

            What happens if I don't go into labour on my due date?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>I remain on call! Most babies come within 2 weeks either side of the due date, and I'm available throughout this window. Whether you go at 37 weeks or 42 weeks, I'll be there.</p>
            <p>If your pregnancy goes beyond 41-42 weeks and you need an induction, I support you through that too. We'll discuss your options and I'll be with you during the induction process.</p>

            Can I change my birth plan during labour?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Of course! Birth plans are guidelines, not contracts. Labour is unpredictable, and you might:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Decide you want pain relief when you didn't plan to</li>
              <li>Need medical interventions you didn't expect</li>
              <li>Change your mind about positions or preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My job is to support YOUR choices in the moment, whatever they are. If you want to change your mind about anything, that's completely okay. I'm here to support you, not your birth plan!</p>
