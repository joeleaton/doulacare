      <h2>Welcome to DoulaCare</h2>

      <p>I'm <strong>Laureen Eaton</strong>, a certified birth doula based in Crawley, West Sussex, serving families across East Sussex and Surrey. With over 10 years of professional experience and more than 50 births supported, I'm passionate about empowering women and their partners to feel confident throughout their birth experience.</p>

      <p>As your doula, I provide comprehensive support that goes beyond medical care. I offer practical, physical, emotional, and spiritual guidance to you and your family before, during, and after the birth of your baby. My role is to ensure you feel safe, supported, and informed every step of the way.</p>

      <h3>Why Choose a Doula?</h3>

      <p>Pregnancy and childbirth are wonderful and exciting times, but they can also bring uncertainty and new experiences as you journey into parenthood. Having a doula by your side can make all the difference. I'm here to:</p>

        <li>Create a calm, nurturing environment for your birth</li>
        <li>Offer postnatal care and breastfeeding support</li>
        <li>Be available 24/7 around your due date</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Experience You Can Trust</h3>

      <p>I bring a wealth of knowledge from supporting diverse birth experiences including:</p>

        <p>"I don't know how I would have managed without my lovely doula, Laureen. She just got on with everything and was really helpful yet not intrusive during the birth. She was calm and sanguine and a Godsend after the birth as I tried to juggle everything."</p>
