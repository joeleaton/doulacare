              <p>I am forever very grateful for how Laureen helped me achieve this precious gift. She made me and my husband feel relaxed and made him feel empowered to make good decisions. Laureen was respectful and supportive of my choices in childbirth. She ensured that my physical needs were taken care of, such as regular drinks, changes of clothing, cleaning up, and packing bags. I can't thank her enough for the back massages when the contractions were so intense.</p>
              <p>Laureen stayed throughout the labour, and ensured I remained calm. Her help didn't stop at childbirth, she continued to be there and help when baby wasn't feeding well, referred us to a lactation consultant, and followed through. Her support, tireless dedication and strength at this important time will never be forgotten by me and my family. She is an amazing person with such a wonderful spirit. I would recommend Laureen's doula services to anyone looking for a positive birth experience.</p>

            <h3>Louise</h3>
            <blockquote class="testimonial">
              <p>For my first baby, I had a medicalised birth, and nearly died from postnatal complications 2 weeks later. I realised I was going to need some extra help to get through my next pregnancy and labour, so I decided to look for a doula and found Laureen. She was so helpful, non-pressurising and confidence building in the run-up to the birth. The antenatal sessions were helpful in reminding my husband and I of how labour works, encouraging us to investigate our options for where to give birth, writing a birth plan and giving us the tools to approach labour differently this time.</p>
              <p>At the birth I felt supported and encouraged by Laureen. It was fantastic to have someone there who completely understood and believed in my birthplan. My husband also greatly appreciated the fact that (unlike last time) he felt he could safely leave my side to take short breaks when he needed to. Our baby was born in a birthing pool with just breathing techniques and gas & air - no other pain relief or medical interventions, just as we'd hoped. We owe that in large part to Laureen's constant encouragement and timely assistance - thank you from the bottom of our hearts!</p>
              <p>As well as being very experienced, it's worth mentioning that Laureen is also very well networked - she's familiar with the delivery suites at all the local hospitals, she knows many of the homebirth midwives and, although not a medical professional, she understands how the local healthcare system works, which is a big plus, particularly if you need to negotiate permission for a slightly, 'non standard' birth plan! She also runs the Crawley and Horsham Positive Birth Movement group, which I was able to attend antenatally, and found very helpful. I'd definitely recommend Laureen to anyone who needs a bit of extra support to get through pregnancy and labour, or anyone seeking a natural, family-centred approach to childbirth.</p>

              <p>We had been planning to have a family for some time, but I was always scared of the idea of giving birth. When I found out I was pregnant, I was convinced that I would insist on an elective C-section because of my fear. We actually never thought about hiring a doula, until we were introduced to Laureen.</p>
              <p>Laureen is an amazing doula, she opened my mind and educated me and my partner on so many aspects of labour - from exercises to ensure the baby is the right position to correct breathing techniques for every stage of labour.</p>
              <p>When I think about my labour, I only have positive memories. Thanks to Laureen I was able to fully concentrate on birthing my baby and handle my contractions by using the correct breathing technique and a TENS machine.</p>
              <p>I found Laureen particularly helpful during the pushing stage when I felt I was not able to do this any longer. She was a great support for myself and my partner who was very calm and supportive, thanks to Laureen's presence. Laureen gave us the confidence to follow our instincts and I gave birth to beautiful healthy baby!</p>
              <p>Looking back, I cannot believe that we had not thought about having a doula before. It was one of the best decisions/investments we have ever made.</p>

              <p>We chose to have Laureen as our doula for our second birth and once again it is one of the best decisions we have made. Laureen has been a great pillar of support throughout the birth of our baby girl. It was so great to have the extra person especially as we had a toddler to sort out before hand. Whilst my husband was dealing with my toddler Laureen stayed with me and helped me through my contractions. The constant reassurance that I am doing great from Laureen helped me get through my contractions and give birth naturally without any interventions and painkillers. I am so glad that we chose to have a doula and that being Laureen who is absolutely caring and gentle made it worth it.</p>

            <h3>Hannah, Ben, and baby Talitha</h3>
            <blockquote class="testimonial">
              <p>Right from the first antenatal meeting with Laureen I began to feel more positive about the upcoming birth of my second child. She explained ways I could start preparing even two months before the birth. Then, when contractions started it was great to know I could call someone as soon as I needed. She was immediately reassuring when she came and helped me stay active throughout. She got me in effective positions in labour and she did amazing massage, which was helpful in relieving pain. Crucially she also showed my husband how to help me with massage and positioning, which made for a much better experience than labour for my first child, when I felt very alone. The emotional support of having an experienced, warm, kind woman, who was totally FOR ME, alongside to encourage me was so important and very reassuring.</p>
              <p>In the hospital Laureen's encouraging words definitely helped me to keep going despite the exhaustion. I would probably have needed the small intervention sooner if it hadn't been for Laureen telling me I could do it. In the end I felt I had done my absolute best and was left with no regrets about the birth.</p>
              <p>Not many women know how to labour effectively and Laureen was good at explaining and helping me do just that. I'd especially recommend her to women who had previous disappointments or a difficult labour and want a more positive experience second time round.</p>

            <h3>Lexi, Guy and baby Tabitha</h3>
            <blockquote class="testimonial">
              <p>When I fell pregnant with my fifth (and last) baby we decided that this was going to be the best birth experience yet! I'd always had relatively straightforward births but suffered from fear and panic attacks when I thought about going through labour again. We also thought my husband would have to be at home during the birth looking after the other children as we have a distinct lack of family to help us. So we looked into engaging a doula, and chose to meet Laureen. Well, from the minute we met I warmed to this lovely lady. Lacking a mum or sisters I knew that I could trust her to be a positive female presence during a time of such vulnerability.</p>
              <p>One moment I distinctly remember through the haze: I was screaming for an epidural while Laureen was quietly and calmly reassuring me that I didn't need one. As I became quite determined indeed, I heard her telling the midwife confidently that I was, in fact, in the transition phase. Somewhere deep within me I knew Laureen was right and that the baby would come soon without intervention. She was indeed spot on! Baby Tabitha needed a little (manual) help to come out, but very soon after my adamant demands for pain relief she was safely here.</p>
              <p>I'd suffered three times before with depression and anxiety after my births; this time I was flying high with confidence, joy and energy!</p>
              <p>So to conclude I must express my one regret - that I hadn't known Laureen for my previous births. She did a really great job. Thank you Laureen!</p>

            <blockquote class="testimonial">
              <p>Thank you Laureen for being our doula for the birth of William. During my pregnancy, I had heard many stories from friends, acquaintances, and in the media of difficult birth experiences, and so I was feeling rather nervous in the run up to labour. I knew that I wanted a third person with us to help us feel calm and safe, and to guide us through. Laureen did just that. On the day, she came to our house and was a reassuring background presence as the contractions got stronger.</p>
              <p>Once in the hospital, I progressed quickly and ended up spending most of the labour in triage without a midwife present. It was extremely positive to have Laureen with us to ensure us that things were progressing as expected. Her presence was invaluable during the pushing stage when things became rather intense. She helped me to calm down my breathing so that I could push effectively, She then took some beautiful photos after the birth and helped me to get settled in the post-natal ward. I would recommend Laureen to add calm and reassurance to your birth.</p>

            <blockquote class="testimonial">
              <p>I had a very medicalised and traumatic birth with my first child, and when I became pregnant again I decided to put the birth to the back of my mind and not think about it, as it was such a long way off. At 37 weeks I started to panic and then began to look into hiring a Doula. I was fortunate that Laureen was available.</p>
              <p>From the first meeting I felt more confident. On the day of the birth Laureen was amazing, she gave me constant encouragement and didn't leave my side once. She was able to completely understand my birth plan and make sure I stuck to it. I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, using just gas and air. I was able to have the natural calm birth I wanted. Without Laureen I am not sure this would have been possible. Thank you Laureen.</p>

              <p>Laureen is an amazing doula! Without you I just don't know how I would have gone through all of this, especially as my mum wasn't here. You were always there when I needed you. On that night when I was having contractions the lower back massage that you gave me was so helpful that I didn't really feel the pain; you also helped me to relax and breath. I was so lucky that I didn't have to go in an ambulance because you took me in your car and I felt more comfortable. Even after I had given birth you helped me get Jaden latched on and also helped me have a shower. You took so much care of me. It was amazing, you were just like a mum to me. Thank you so so much for everything.</p>

              <p>I'd like to say how much I appreciated having you at the birth of our baby boy. Although I was initially unsure about having someone outside the family at the birth, I have to say that I would not hesitate to recommend the help of a doula to anyone, especially anyone feeling uncertain or afraid about giving birth! Your massage was amazing and really helped to ease the pain. Your advice about relaxation and breathing - and your knowledge - is invaluable and you definitely provided alternative support to that of my husband and mum. Thank you so much for being there for me. I know my husband was relieved you were there to support me 100%, even after the birth when he needed to be with the baby in the special care unit.</p>

              <p>Well, where do I start?! Laureen has been absolutely wonderful from the minute we met her. Laureen is a very down-to-earth and honest person who gave us the best advice and support we could ask for. We were very determined to have a natural birth and Laureen made that possible for us. She was there every step of the way and made sure we weren't forced to do something that we didn't want to.

              <p>The word Doula originates from the Greek and it means female helper, but I believe a far better fitting description of Laureen would be 'Pain absorbing Birth Mother'.</p>
              <p>This is my special journey guided by my special Doula: On the 21st of March I gave birth to my bundle of joy without pain relief or medical intervention. My journey began a long time before this date however and I surely would have been lost without Laureen. Laureen prepared me for the birth, labour and the difficult few weeks following the birth. She was always available for a chat if I felt insecure about something and had excellent advice with heaps of comforting words. I also took breathing techniques with Laureen which I highly recommend, she taught me to breathe through almost any pain, not just childbirth, and I focused on her the whole way through the birth. Laureen taught me that birth and pain are all a mind set which can be overcome if you know what your body is capable of naturally. I also recommend the read of one Laureen's books called A Guide to Spiritual Birth by Ina May Gaskin - do make time for this book before your birth!</p>
              <p>If you want to have a natural birth that you wish to remember as being perfect not painful, Laureen can make your wish come true.</p>

              <p>Laureen taught me relaxation, breathing techniques and exercises during my pregnancy. The exercises were very good in keeping me supple and I practised the relaxation and breathing techniques, as I intended to use them during labour without any other pain relief. I felt more equipped to birth my baby after attending these sessions and very well prepared. At the birth of my baby I used the breathing techniques throughout labour. They really helped me through the contractions, so I did not need any other pain relief. I was also very relaxed during the birth. I am so glad Laureen taught me these techniques as they really helped me.</p>
              <p>At the antenatal sessions Laureen prepared my husband and I extremely well for the birth of our baby, so my birth experience was more than I ever expected. I have three children and this was the first time I've had a doula. This time I really felt in control and more confident. I can definitely say this was my quickest and easiest delivery. I am so thankful to my doula Laureen.</p>

I felt I persevered more because I knew that it might be hard to begin with but that I could get through it.

Meanwhile my husband was busy getting the birthing pool ready as fast as he could! During the third stage of labour Laureen made sure I kept drinking, I didn't even need to ask she just knew what I needed. She was looking after me while the midwife was making sure everything was okay with the baby.

It was very fortunate we did this.</p>

              <p>When I had to have a c-section, Laureen reassured me that I had done all I could in the circumstances. Because I was feeling so vulnerable at that time, her reassurance was vital to my mental well being. This really helped me feel positive. When the baby was born, she helped the baby find the breast and I really do think this very early intervention has been the reason breast feeding has been so natural, straight forward and easy for me and baby.</p>

She was amazing with my little boy, she often took him to the park, he really warmed to her which was a relief because he was normally quite clingy. When my baby was born, Laureen was great at winding the baby whilst I was with my older boy, and looked after them both at times, so that I could have a bath! It was a real break and she felt like a friend rather than someone I was employing.</p>

              <p>Laureen was a pillar of strength and support for me during the birth of my second son. Having had a traumatic emergency cesarean birth for my first son, I was very keen to have a vaginal birth for my second son. My first baby was posterior. Laureen's suggestions and exercises during my second pregnancy helped maintain my baby in the proper position. On the day when I was in labour, she arrived at my home very quickly once I messaged her. She was highly professional and helped my husband and me remain calm throughout. She massaged my back during every contraction for almost 9 hrs. She reminded me to breathe throughout labour and helped me have the water birth that I wanted, constantly encouraging me at times when I was almost about to give up.</p>
              <p>After the birth she even helped me have a shower and was more like a mom. I don't think the birth would have gone so smooth without her guidance and help. She was a guardian angel. Her experience and professionalism is worth having. I could not have done it without you, Laureen.</p>

              <p>Laureen was very helpful beforehand by lending me books, finding out information and searching the web. She helped me think about what I wanted in my birth plan and taught me some exercises and breathing techniques. She was very positive and encouraging as I wanted a VBAC and I was hoping for a shorter labour, as my previous birth experience was 48 hours. Laureen prepared me well for the birth. At the birth she was very encouraging and helped me with my breathing. She massaged my back and guided me through my first vaginal birth, lasting only 4 hours, making it a positive and good experience. After the birth she was very helpful, insightful and able to answer questions about the birth. She also provided us with a beautiful birth story.</p>
              <p>Her strengths are her age, experience, her calm nature and her encouraging self.</p>
              <p>Labour can be difficult and frightening but having someone there for support, who has been there before, is very comforting.</p>

              <p>I wanted a doula with me for the birth of my second baby as my first birth had been quite traumatic, ending with a C section. This time I wanted to feel more in control of my birth experience and felt a doula could help me achieve the birth I desired. Laureen prepared me very well, covering everything I needed to know. I was well informed about my options and choices. I certainly felt having Laureen with me was helpful during the birth of Elsie as I felt safe and supported and much more in control than I did during the birth of my first baby. I was overjoyed that I had a VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Caesarean). I have been recommending having a Doula to my friends because so many women feel frightened of the prospect of labour or are either traumatised or feel a failure after previous labours. I would consider having a doula for my next birth as I would like to feel safe again, like I had a 'sane' brain by my side who knows what kind of labour I want and can help me achieve it.</p>

              <p>Laureen taught me and my husband some great breathing techniques to help me through labour. As it turned out, the birth didn't go to plan (does it ever?) and as a result I had a difficult labour and birth without any pain relief. I totally relied on the techniques learnt from Laureen and they helped me cope with the experience. I was able to manage the pain while keeping calm and focusing on my breathing. Laureen gave me the positive tools/techniques that I needed to keep motivated during labour and I'd definitely recommend working with her.</p>

              <p>Before the birth, I worked on getting the baby into the ideal position every day using what I learned! This definitely paid off. Once my labor started, I practiced many of the positions we'd discussed. It was especially helpful to walk around a lot, push against things, take a bath, and lean on my birthing ball. These strategies Laureen had shown me enabled me to cope with labour at home for a long time, so by the time I got to the hospital I was nearly finished! I remember really working on my breathing in the car, including using my song - I think we hit every possible red light!</p>
              <p>Doing the sessions with my husband was wonderful; when the time came, he reminded me about my breathing and really encouraged me to stick with my birth plan, reminding me of why we wanted a natural birth and encouraging me to keep moving through the contractions to make things easier. We both felt shocked by the intensity and rawness of labor, however we felt thoroughly informed. We knew what we wanted and we knew what to expect in terms of progression, procedures, how the hospital was likely to handle things, etc. Also as a result of the sessions, we made sure to let the cord finish pulsating before cutting it, and prioritised skin-to-skin contact as soon as possible, which I feel was so valuable for our son. When we got home I felt confident to enjoy a "baby moon" and spend the time bonding with Josiah, which I am so thankful for now that I see how quickly the time flies! Thank you for being such a positive and encouraging part of our journey into parenthood!</p>
