          <h1>About Laureen Eaton</h1>
          
          <p class="lead">Hello, I'm Laureen. I am a mother of five wonderful children, grandmother to eight gorgeous grandchildren, and a passionate advocate for empowering women through their birth journey.</p>
          
          <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
          
          <p>I believe deeply in the innate ability of women to birth their babies. While medical interventions certainly have their place, I've witnessed that most women, when provided with loving support and compassionate care, can give birth without unnecessary intervention. Birth is not a medical emergency—it's a natural, transformative life event.</p>
          
          <h2>My Journey to Becoming a Doula</h2>
          
          <p>My journey into doula work began with a profound moment. After having the privilege of attending the birth of one of my grandchildren, the midwife observed that I would make an ideal birth partner. This comment sparked something within me—a realization that I could use my life experience to help other women achieve positive, empowering birth experiences.</p>
          
          <p>I wanted other mothers to look back on their births with joy and fulfillment, rather than trauma or regret. This desire led me to train as both a birth and postnatal doula in 2007, and I haven't looked back since.</p>
          
          <h2>What I Bring to Your Birth</h2>
          
          <p>When I enter your birthing space, I bring more than just professional training. I bring a calming, loving presence that has been cultivated through:</p>
          
          <ul class="custom-list">
            <li><strong>Over 10 years</strong> of professional doula experience</li>
            <li><strong>More than 50 births</strong> supported across various settings</li>
            <li><strong>Personal experience</strong> as a mother of five and grandmother of eight</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive training</strong> in birth support, breastfeeding, and postnatal care</li>
            <li><strong>A genuine passion</strong> for empowering women and their families</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>My aim is to equip you with knowledge so you can make informed decisions about your birth. I provide both you and your partner with the care, support, and encouragement you deserve, helping to make your birth experience positive, joyful, and memorable for all the right reasons.</p>
          
          <h2>Professional Qualifications</h2>
          
          <p>I hold the following professional certifications and qualifications:</p>
          
          <ul class="custom-list">
            <li><strong>Certified Birth Doula</strong> with Nurturing Birth</li>
            <li><strong>Recognised Doula</strong> with Doula UK (adhering to their philosophy and code of conduct)</li>
            <li><strong>Full Professional Liability Insurance</strong></li>
            <li><strong>DBS (CRB) Checked</strong> for your peace of mind</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>My Background in Education</h2>
          
          <p>Before becoming a doula, I spent many years in education. I am a qualified infant teacher and taught until my first baby arrived. Following this, I became a supervisor at our local playgroup, where I remained involved for many years.</p>
          
          <p>Later, I pursued a different direction and trained to teach ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages). For sixteen years, I worked as an Adult Education tutor, with six of those years on a voluntary basis. This background in education has given me strong communication skills and the ability to explain complex information in accessible, supportive ways.</p>
          
          <h2>Continuing Professional Development</h2>
          
          <p>I am committed to staying current with best practices in maternity care. My ongoing professional development includes:</p>

          <h2>Birth Experience Across Multiple Settings</h2>
          
          <p>I have extensive hands-on experience supporting births in various environments:</p>
          
          <h3>Hospital Births</h3>
          <p>I have supported families at:</p>
          <ul class="custom-list">
            <li>Worthing Hospital</li>
            <li>East Surrey Hospital</li>
            <li>St Richard's Hospital, Chichester</li>
            <li>The Princess Royal Hospital, Haywards Heath</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Home Births & Birthing Centres</h3>
          <p>I am equally comfortable supporting births in home settings and birthing centres. I have attended numerous home births and can provide a birthing pool if you choose a water birth at home.</p>
          
          <h3>Diverse Birth Experiences</h3>
          <p>My experience includes supporting:</p>
          <ul class="custom-list">
            <li>Induced labours</li>
            <li>Births with epidurals</li>

            <li>Completely natural, intervention-free births</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>This breadth of experience means I can support you regardless of how your birth unfolds. I meet you where you are and adapt my support to your unique needs and circumstances.</p>
          
          <h2>The Wisdom of Experience</h2>
          
          <p>Being a mother of five and grandmother many times over has given me invaluable insight into the journey of parenthood. Combined with the knowledge I gain from each birth I attend, I can offer you a wealth of practical information and emotional support as you navigate childbirth and the early days of parenthood.</p>
          
          <p>Every birth teaches me something new, and I bring this accumulated wisdom to support your family with compassion, patience, and understanding.</p>
