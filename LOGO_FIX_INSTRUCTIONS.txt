LOGO NOT SHOWING ON LIVE SITE - FIX INSTRUCTIONS
================================================

The logo works locally but not on your live server. This is a MIME type issue.

SOLUTION 1: Upload .htaccess file (RECOMMENDED)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Upload the .htaccess file to your root directory (same level as index.html)
2. This tells your server to serve SVG files correctly
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Logo should now appear

If your server doesn't support .htaccess or it still doesn't work:


SOLUTION 2: Use PNG version instead
-----------------------------------
Since SVG isn't working on your server, use a PNG image instead:

Step 1: Convert the logo to PNG
   - Open images/doulacare_logo.svg in a browser
   - Take a screenshot or use an online converter
   - Save as: doulacare_logo.png (400px wide, 100px tall)
   - Or use this command if you have ImageMagick:
     convert images/doulacare_logo.svg -resize 400x100 images/doulacare_logo.png

Step 2: Update ALL HTML files
   Change this line in EVERY .html file:
   
   FROM:
   <img src="images/doulacare_logo.svg" alt="DoulaCare logo with heart symbol" class="logo">
   
   TO:
   <img src="images/doulacare_logo.png" alt="DoulaCare logo with heart symbol" class="logo">
   
   Files to update:
   - index.html
   - about.html
   - services.html
   - what-is-a-doula.html
   - facts.html
   - faq.html
   - testimonials.html
   - contact.html

Step 3: Upload
   - Upload the new doulacare_logo.png to images/ folder
   - Re-upload all the HTML files
   - Clear cache and refresh


SOLUTION 3: Check server settings
---------------------------------
Contact your hosting provider and ask them to:
1. Enable SVG MIME type (image/svg+xml)
2. Or ask if .htaccess files are supported


QUICK TEST
----------
After uploading .htaccess:
1. Visit: https://doulacare.net/images/doulacare_logo.svg
2. Should see the logo displayed
3. If you see XML code instead, MIME type still not working
4. Use PNG solution instead


WHICH SOLUTION?
--------------
- Try Solution 1 (.htaccess) first - easiest
- If that doesn't work, use Solution 2 (PNG) - guaranteed to work
