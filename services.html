        <h2>3. One-to-One Birth Preparation Sessions</h2>

        <p>Perhaps you don't want a doula present at your birth, but would still like professional, personalised birth preparation in the comfort of your own home. These sessions are perfect for couples who:</p>

        <ul class="custom-list">
          <li>Couldn't attend antenatal classes due to scheduling</li>
          <li>Want more personalised attention than group classes provide</li>

          <li>Have specific questions or concerns about their upcoming birth</li>
        </ul>

          <h2 id="placenta-smoothie">About Placenta Smoothies</h2>

          <p>If you're interested in placenta encapsulation or consumption, I can prepare a fresh <strong>placenta smoothie</strong> for you shortly after birth. This involves blending a small piece of your placenta with fruit to create a nutrient-rich drink.</p>

          <p>Some families choose this option believing it may help with:</p>
          <ul class="custom-list">
            <li>Milk production</li>
            <li>Energy levels</li>
            <li>Hormonal balance</li>
            <li>Postnatal recovery</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This is entirely optional and discussed during our prenatal meetings if you're interested.</p>

          <h2>Affording Doula Care</h2>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Doula UK Hardship Fund</h3>
            <p>As a member of Doula UK, I have access to a <strong>Hardship Fund</strong> designed to assist families who might otherwise be unable to afford a doula. If you're facing financial challenges, please <a href="http://www.birthbliss.co.uk/index.php?expand=1&menuID=45&pageID=34&submenuID=51&subpageID=38" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit this link for further details</a> about applying.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Payment Plans</h3>
            <p>If you don't qualify for the hardship fund, I'm happy to arrange a <strong>flexible payment plan</strong> to make doula care more accessible. Please don't let cost prevent you from reaching out—let's have a conversation about what's possible.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Gift Vouchers</h3>
            <p>Consider asking friends and family for <strong>Doula UK gift vouchers</strong> instead of traditional baby shower presents. Having a doula can be more valuable than another toy or outfit. Many families have successfully crowdfunded their doula care this way!</p>
          </div>
