After my very calm and gentle homebirth with my second son, I felt certain that I could cope with having my third baby at home in much the same way. I wanted the help of a doula initially for practical help, we have 2 other children and no family nearby. However my third birth was very different from the second, it progressed very rapidly and very suddenly. Laureen arrived to find me in active labour. I was beginning to feel a little out of control and she helped keep me calm, reminding me about my breathing techniques and relaxing my shoulders; she really helped me cope with a very fast powerful birth. Meanwhile my husband was busy getting the birthing pool ready as fast as he could! During the third stage of labour Laureen made sure I kept drinking, I didn't even need to ask she just knew what I needed. She was looking after me while the midwife was making sure everything was okay with the baby. From the moment she arrived until I was tucked up in bed with my baby Laureen's contribution was invaluable, she looked after me with kindness and sensitivity. Her visits the following week were a great help too!
