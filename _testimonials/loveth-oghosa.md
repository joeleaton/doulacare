Laureen is an amazing doula! I met Laureen after a friend introduced her to me just a few weeks before my baby was due. My friend thought it would be a great help for me to have someone with me at the birth of my second child, as I am a single mum. Laureen was the right person!

I was so grateful to have Laureen's calming presence, especially when I had to make an important decision. She listened carefully to me and answered my questions so I was able to make the right decision.
