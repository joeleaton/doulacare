I had Laureen for post natal support. We just clicked when I invited her to my home to meet up and I knew she was the right person for us. I found my doula was absolutely fabulous. For me she was perfect. Laureen listened carefully to what I wanted for my baby while I was taking a rest and did exactly what I asked her. She actually did more than required. She followed up on some concerns I had over my baby's sleep. She also helped me with some household jobs which were perfectly carried out. My husband felt extremely happy that I found the help I needed and was very relieved when away on a business trip knowing someone so kind and experienced like Laureen was looking after his girls. She is an experienced doula and a very kind and gentle person. I could not have found a better person. I feel it is sometimes easier to receive help from a person like a doula rather than parents/in-laws because she give the exact help one needs without conveying in the feelings grandparents might have.
