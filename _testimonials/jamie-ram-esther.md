Laureen taught me relaxation, breathing techniques and exercises during my pregnancy. The exercises were very good in keeping me supple and I practised the relaxation and breathing techniques, as I intended to use them during labour without any other pain relief. I felt more equipped to birth my baby after attending these sessions and very well prepared. At the birth of my baby I used the breathing techniques throughout labour. They really helped me through the contractions, so I did not need any other pain relief. I was also very relaxed during the birth. I am so glad Laureen taught me these techniques as they really helped me.

At the antenatal sessions Laureen prepared my husband and I extremely well for the birth of our baby, so my birth experience was more than I ever expected. I have three children and this was the first time I've had a doula. This time I really felt in control and more confident. I can definitely say this was my quickest and easiest delivery. I am so thankful to my doula Laureen.

I would recommend that pregnant women have a doula, as mine helped me so much.
