Having had a very negative experience breastfeeding my first child, I knew that I wanted additional support postnatally with my second child. Before George was born Laureen visited us and gave us lots of useful information about breastfeeding. I loved the focus on biological nurturing in particular. Once George was born, she was available to come over straight away.

I struggled to feed for several days, but Laureen was always a calm presence, offering practical suggestions without being pushy.
