As a first time mum I had a wonderful birthing experiencing. I could not have done it without her. From the home visits during pregnancy to being with me during my birth and the the home visits post partum, I am so happy that I made the decision to hire her as my doula. She's an incredible woman. Get in touch with her. You won't regret it!
