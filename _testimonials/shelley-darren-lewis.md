I'd like to say how much I appreciated having you at the birth of our baby boy. Although I was initially unsure about having someone outside the family at the birth, I have to say that I would not hesitate to recommend the help of a doula to anyone, especially anyone feeling uncertain or afraid about giving birth! Your massage was amazing and really helped to ease the pain. Your advice about relaxation and breathing - and your knowledge - is invaluable and you definitely provided alternative support to that of my husband and mum. Thank you so much for being there for me. I know my husband was relieved you were there to support me 100%, even after the birth when he needed to be with the baby in the special care unit.
