Laureen is an amazing doula! Without you I just don't know how I would have gone through all of this, especially as my mum wasn't here. You were always there when I needed you. On that night when I was having contractions the lower back massage that you gave me was so helpful that I didn't really feel the pain; you also helped me to relax and breath. I was so lucky that I didn't have to go in an ambulance because you took me in your car and I felt more comfortable. Even after I had given birth you helped me get Jaden latched on and also helped me have a shower. You took so much care of me. It was amazing, you were just like a mum to me. Thank you so so much for everything.
