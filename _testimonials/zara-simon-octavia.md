Laureen was brilliant from the start. She answered my phone call and talked me through the services she offers. She was so friendly. When she came for our antenatal meeting she had so much information about labour, birth and breastfeeding, which put our minds at ease. We both really enjoyed her two sessions as she gave us so much insight into the wonderful labour. I found it was so helpful to practice the breathing and getting into the different positions she showed me for labour and giving birth.

Laureen helped with latching on and breastfeeding from the beginning. She also helped me have a bath and then dress my daughter with my nervous and overwhelmed husband. She came and visited us three times after the birth, reassuring us and answering our questions.
