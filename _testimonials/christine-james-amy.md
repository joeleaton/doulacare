Laureen is an amazing doula. Both my husband and I can attest to Laureen's ability and knowledge. Her presence during the birth of our daughter was a tremendous help. This was our fourth pregnancy and second homebirth and after the 1st homebirth I knew I would want to have an experienced and encouraging coach to help me along the way. Laureen was very professional and nurturing throughout the labor and delivery. She was quick to suggest laboring positions and to ask questions and make suggestions that were in my best interests and was a great cheerleader in moments where I thought I would not be able to deliver the baby. Thanks again Laureen!
