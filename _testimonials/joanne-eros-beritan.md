I had a doula because I have 5 children and of course was not sure of the time of day I would have my home birth. In addition the NHS policy means you get a random midwife who may or may not be on board with your birth plan and I preferred to have a matriarchal figure with me who could be a good advocate for me.

I do not know how I would have managed without my lovely doula, Laureen. She just got on with everything and was really helpful yet not intrusive during the birth. She was calm and sanguine and a God send after the birth as I tried to juggle everything.

It was good to have someone looking after your needs from water to cold flannel to homeopathic remedy and helpful suggestions, yet not intrusive just quiet and calm in the background - supporting.

After Beritan's birth she was a great to help with all the practicalities such as looking after me (for example making me tea and making sure I drank enough!), holding the baby while I saw to myself, caring for the baby so that I could eat. Laureen also helped by getting the baby to sleep.

It was great to have domestic support, essential even. I would have drowned under the weight of everything otherwise and been very stressed.
