Charlotte was born on the 17th October 2009. Ian and I wanted to say that the experience was really enhanced by having our wonderful Doula Laureen. As a doula she really made us feel relaxed and in charge of our own destiny. Through her constant reassurance I was able to focus on achieving a natural birth and gave birth to a beautiful baby daughter weighing 8 pounds 10 oz. Thanks Laureen!
