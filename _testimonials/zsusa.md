Laureen answered all my questions and went over some breathing exercises. She is very personable, friendly, caring and knowledgeable. Laureen was so thorough in preparing me for the birth and I found the antenatal sessions extremely useful. I think learning breathing techniques really helped during labour and birth. I didn't need any pain relief this time. Laureen was a great support to me and my family during and after the birth. She was just great and I would recommend a doula to anyone.
