From the very first moment we spoke, I felt an instant connection. When you came to my home to explain how you could support me, I already knew in my heart that you were the right person. The way you spoke, the calm confidence you carried, and the positivity you radiated gave me a new energy and excitement.

Pregnancy can be filled with so many stressful stories, especially around labor. Most of what we hear are the difficult experiences, and I was no different, anxious and unsure. But you changed that for me. You told me I could do it, that I had no reason to worry, and you backed that reassurance with thoughtful, informative materials that helped me understand what to expect.

Being away from family and juggling full‑time work wasn’t easy, but you stepped into my life with warmth, experience, and unwavering support. You prepared me to go natural, and even though I ended up choosing an epidural at 8 cm (I still feel like I let you down!), you never once made me feel anything but supported. You stayed by my side the entire night, kept me calm, and held my baby with such tenderness. Your presence made everything feel safe.

My baby decided to come one month early and my husband called you, you were at the hospital quickly. That alone speaks volumes about the kind of person you are, dedicated, dependable, and incredibly caring. You were always just a call away, always ready with helpful suggestions, and always there when I needed reassurance.

Laureen, thank you. You made my birth experience something I look back on with gratitude instead of fear. You brought positivity, strength, and comfort into a moment that could have been overwhelming. I truly believe we need more women like you in this world -  women who lift others up, who bring light into vulnerable moments, and who make us feel capable and supported.

No words can fully express what you’ve done for me, but I hope this letter gives you even a glimpse of how deeply I appreciate you.
