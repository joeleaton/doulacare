When I fell pregnant with my fifth (and last) baby we decided that this was going to be the best birth experience yet! I'd always had relatively straightforward births but suffered from fear and panic attacks when I thought about going through labour again. We also thought my husband would have to be at home during the birth looking after the other children as we have a distinct lack of family to help us. So we looked into engaging a doula, and chose to meet Laureen. Well, from the minute we met I warmed to this lovely lady. Lacking a mum or sisters I knew that I could trust her to be a positive female presence during a time of such vulnerability.

One moment I distinctly remember through the haze: I was screaming for an epidural while Laureen was quietly and calmly reassuring me that I didn't need one. As I became quite determined indeed, I heard her telling the midwife confidently that I was, in fact, in the transition phase. Somewhere deep within me I knew Laureen was right and that the baby would come soon without intervention. She was indeed spot on! Baby Tabitha needed a little (manual) help to come out, but very soon after my adamant demands for pain relief she was safely here.

I'd suffered three times before with depression and anxiety after my births; this time I was flying high with confidence, joy and energy!

So to conclude I must express my one regret - that I hadn't known Laureen for my previous births. She did a really great job. Thank you Laureen!
