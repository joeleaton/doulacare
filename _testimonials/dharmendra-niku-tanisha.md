We wanted a doula as we were keen to have a home birth and felt that having Laureen with us would be helpful towards this. First Laureen gave me and my husband one-to-one antenatal sessions, where we heard essential information which was not mentioned at NHS classes. Laureen gave us lots of forward planning suggestions, which we would never have thought of. Laureen was amazing, not only during my labour, where she will helped me with breathing techniques, back massage, positions and with reassurance through what was happening to me, but she also cooked and washed up and offered to do anything in the house. I had to transfer to hospital, but Laureen came and supported me there. She stayed with me the whole time I was in labour. Laureen is worth every penny. Thank you very much Laureen. I couldn't have done it without you!
