Having Laureen as our doula prepared us so well for the birth and immediate aftermath. Pre-birth, Laureen was calm, gave us lots of info and guided us when we asked for it. She also recommended we prepared a few birth plans to cover different scenarios which was a great way to prepare us for the fact that labour and birth does not always go to plan! It was very fortunate we did this.

During the labour, she supported me brilliantly, massaging my back and told me a wonderful breathing technique to help me during the most intense contractions. Having her there also meant I knew my husband wasn't having to do it all himself, I could be as demanding as I needed to be without it stressing him out!

When I had to have a c-section, Laureen reassured me that I had done all I could in the circumstances. Because I was feeling so vulnerable at that time, her reassurance was vital to my mental well being. This really helped me feel positive. When the baby was born, she helped the baby find the breast and I really do think this very early intervention has been the reason breast feeding has been so natural, straight forward and easy for me and baby.

Laureen was very gentle in her approach and I would not hesitate to use her again.

I would also thoroughly recommend the placenta smoothie! My recovery was swift, my energy was high and I had no baby Blues- all of which I attribute in the main to the placenta smoothie. And no, you can't taste it! It is refreshing and just what you need after birth!
