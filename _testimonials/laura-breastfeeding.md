Before the birth my expectations of a doula was that they would provide emotional support and guide me through my contractions and assist with positions etc. Laureen met those expectations. However, I received much more than this. I wanted a low intervention birth and ideally without an epidural and she advocated natural labour and, to my amazement, I managed labour with only a little gas and air! I also found our session about breast feeding really helped me especially in the very early days after my baby was born. I felt I persevered more because I knew that it might be hard to begin with but that I could get through it. These are just a few examples of how my ante-natal sessions served me but I would recommend them to anyone as I feel that the more you are informed the better prepared you are for any eventuality!
