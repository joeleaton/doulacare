We had been planning to have a family for some time, but I was always scared of the idea of giving birth. When I found out I was pregnant, I was convinced that I would insist on an elective C-section because of my fear. We actually never thought about hiring a doula, until we were introduced to Laureen.

Laureen is an amazing doula, she opened my mind and educated me and my partner on so many aspects of labour - from exercises to ensure the baby is the right position to correct breathing techniques for every stage of labour.

When I think about my labour, I only have positive memories. Thanks to Laureen I was able to fully concentrate on birthing my baby and handle my contractions by using the correct breathing technique and a TENS machine.

I found Laureen particularly helpful during the pushing stage when I felt I was not able to do this any longer. She was a great support for myself and my partner who was very calm and supportive, thanks to Laureen's presence. Laureen gave us the confidence to follow our instincts and I gave birth to beautiful healthy baby!

Looking back, I cannot believe that we had not thought about having a doula before. It was one of the best decisions/investments we have ever made.
