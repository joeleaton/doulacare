Well, where do I start?! Laureen has been absolutely wonderful from the minute we met her. Laureen is a very down-to-earth and honest person who gave us the best advice and support we could ask for. We were very determined to have a natural birth and Laureen made that possible for us. She was there every step of the way and made sure we weren't forced to do something that we didn't want to. We can look back at the birth of our baby boy and remember it with a smile on our faces.
