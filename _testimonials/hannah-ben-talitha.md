Right from the first antenatal meeting with Laureen I began to feel more positive about the upcoming birth of my second child. She explained ways I could start preparing even two months before the birth. Then, when contractions started it was great to know I could call someone as soon as I needed. She was immediately reassuring when she came and helped me stay active throughout. She got me in effective positions in labour and she did amazing massage, which was helpful in relieving pain. Crucially she also showed my husband how to help me with massage and positioning, which made for a much better experience than labour for my first child, when I felt very alone. The emotional support of having an experienced, warm, kind woman, who was totally FOR ME, alongside to encourage me was so important and very reassuring.

In the hospital Laureen's encouraging words definitely helped me to keep going despite the exhaustion. I would probably have needed the small intervention sooner if it hadn't been for Laureen telling me I could do it. In the end I felt I had done my absolute best and was left with no regrets about the birth.

Not many women know how to labour effectively and Laureen was good at explaining and helping me do just that. I'd especially recommend her to women who had previous disappointments or a difficult labour and want a more positive experience second time round.
