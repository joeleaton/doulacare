Laureen came to me when I was 38 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child. I was exhausted. She was so helpful, she asked me for an upfront lesson in all my appliances so that she could get on with them, the oven, dishwasher, washing machine etc, which meant I could throw anything at her so to speak and she could handle it. She was amazing with my little boy, she often took him to the park, he really warmed to her which was a relief because he was normally quite clingy. When my baby was born, Laureen was great at winding the baby whilst I was with my older boy, and looked after them both at times, so that I could have a bath! It was a real break and she felt like a friend rather than someone I was employing.
