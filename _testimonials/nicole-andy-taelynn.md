The word Doula originates from the Greek and it means female helper, but I believe a far better fitting description of Laureen would be 'Pain absorbing Birth Mother'.

This is my special journey guided by my special Doula: On the 21st of March I gave birth to my bundle of joy without pain relief or medical intervention. My journey began a long time before this date however and I surely would have been lost without Laureen. Laureen prepared me for the birth, labour and the difficult few weeks following the birth. She was always available for a chat if I felt insecure about something and had excellent advice with heaps of comforting words. I also took breathing techniques with Laureen which I highly recommend, she taught me to breathe through almost any pain, not just childbirth, and I focused on her the whole way through the birth. Laureen taught me that birth and pain are all a mind set which can be overcome if you know what your body is capable of naturally. I also recommend the read of one Laureen's books called A Guide to Spiritual Birth by Ina May Gaskin - do make time for this book before your birth!

If you want to have a natural birth that you wish to remember as being perfect not painful, Laureen can make your wish come true.
