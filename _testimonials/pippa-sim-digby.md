Laureen supported us as a family since our baby was about 2 weeks. Her main role was to support me with my other son and with chores which allowed me time to breastfeed the baby when my husband was away with work. She was very skilled in getting my 2 year old up and dressed even when he was being difficult and this allowed me to breast feed the baby before taking my son to nursery. I then left the baby with Laureen, to burp him and give a bath. She has also helped me in the evening playing with my older child, giving him a bath, getting him ready for bed and reading him a story. She has a calm and gentle manner which both children have responded very well to. She instinctively knew what needed to be done.

Laureen gave me support and ideas when I had an odd rash and when was struggling with milk supply in the evenings. She also contacted the forum for me to ask others for their ideas.

Laureen has been a huge help at the moments Ive most needed support and she has been very flexible in when she is happy to come to support.
