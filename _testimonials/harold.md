Our first pregnancy was much much smoother thanks to the wisdom, help and support we received from Laureen. She was always very interested in our progress during the different stages of our pregnancy and this showed through the many pieces of advice and physical support she would give us as we got closer and closer to delivery day.

Then came the delivery day and we checked into the hospital around 3/4am thinking it was too early for anyone to support us but that wasn't the case for Laureen! She made her way to us ASAP when she got the call and was a fantastic anchor and support in the delivery room and throughout the delivery process.

I cannot recommend her enough if you want a down-to-earth professional that really cares about your pregnancy journey.
