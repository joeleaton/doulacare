Before the birth, I worked on getting the baby into the ideal position every day using what I learned! This definitely paid off. Once my labor started, I practiced many of the positions we'd discussed. It was especially helpful to walk around a lot, push against things, take a bath, and lean on my birthing ball. These strategies Laureen had shown me enabled me to cope with labour at home for a long time, so by the time I got to the hospital I was nearly finished! I remember really working on my breathing in the car, including using my song - I think we hit every possible red light!

Doing the sessions with my husband was wonderful; when the time came, he reminded me about my breathing and really encouraged me to stick with my birth plan, reminding me of why we wanted a natural birth and encouraging me to keep moving through the contractions to make things easier. We both felt shocked by the intensity and rawness of labor, however we felt thoroughly informed. We knew what we wanted and we knew what to expect in terms of progression, procedures, how the hospital was likely to handle things, etc. Also as a result of the sessions, we made sure to let the cord finish pulsating before cutting it, and prioritised skin-to-skin contact as soon as possible, which I feel was so valuable for our son. When we got home I felt confident to enjoy a "baby moon" and spend the time bonding with Josiah, which I am so thankful for now that I see how quickly the time flies! Thank you for being such a positive and encouraging part of our journey into parenthood!
