I wanted a doula with me for the birth of my second baby as my first birth had been quite traumatic, ending with a C section. This time I wanted to feel more in control of my birth experience and felt a doula could help me achieve the birth I desired. Laureen prepared me very well, covering everything I needed to know. I was well informed about my options and choices. I certainly felt having Laureen with me was helpful during the birth of Elsie as I felt safe and supported and much more in control than I did during the birth of my first baby. I was overjoyed that I had a VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Caesarean). I have been recommending having a Doula to my friends because so many women feel frightened of the prospect of labour or are either traumatised or feel a failure after previous labours. I would consider having a doula for my next birth as I would like to feel safe again, like I had a 'sane' brain by my side who knows what kind of labour I want and can help me achieve it.
