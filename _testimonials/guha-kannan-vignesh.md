Laureen was a pillar of strength and support for me during the birth of my second son. Having had a traumatic emergency cesarean birth for my first son, I was very keen to have a vaginal birth for my second son. My first baby was posterior. Laureen's suggestions and exercises during my second pregnancy helped maintain my baby in the proper position. On the day when I was in labour, she arrived at my home very quickly once I messaged her. She was highly professional and helped my husband and me remain calm throughout. She massaged my back during every contraction for almost 9 hrs. She reminded me to breathe throughout labour and helped me have the water birth that I wanted, constantly encouraging me at times when I was almost about to give up.

After the birth she even helped me have a shower and was more like a mom. I don't think the birth would have gone so smooth without her guidance and help. She was a guardian angel. Her experience and professionalism is worth having. I could not have done it without you, Laureen.
