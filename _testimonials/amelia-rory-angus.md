Laureen has been a great support to our family for 9 months after our baby was born. During pregnancy, I was very tired, especially towards the end. When I rang Laureen, I was only a few days away from giving birth but she was able to make herself readily available and come and help us.

Laureen came every week for several months giving me time to focus on my baby and my 3 year old. Laureen is extremely reliable and professional and will gladly turn her hand to any task. She would hold and calm my baby while I had a shower. The baby would happily fall asleep on her. Laureen provided us with so much support and I am so pleased we chose her as she is a very calming presence and a natural homemaker. Thank you Laureen!
