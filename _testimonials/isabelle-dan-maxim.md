Laureen was our doula for the second time last May and yet again she was truly amazing. She keep me and my husband calm and level headed. I don't think I would have had such a successful home birth without her. She guided us through what would have been quite a difficult birthing experience and also helped us with our three year old daughter Josephine who attended the birth of her baby brother. We will never forget what she did for us as a family. Thank you Laureen.
