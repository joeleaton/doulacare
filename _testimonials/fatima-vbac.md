Laureen was very helpful beforehand by lending me books, finding out information and searching the web. She helped me think about what I wanted in my birth plan and taught me some exercises and breathing techniques. She was very positive and encouraging as I wanted a VBAC and I was hoping for a shorter labour, as my previous birth experience was 48 hours. Laureen prepared me well for the birth. At the birth she was very encouraging and helped me with my breathing. She massaged my back and guided me through my first vaginal birth, lasting only 4 hours, making it a positive and good experience. After the birth she was very helpful, insightful and able to answer questions about the birth. She also provided us with a beautiful birth story.

Her strengths are her age, experience, her calm nature and her encouraging self.

Labour can be difficult and frightening but having someone there for support, who has been there before, is very comforting.
