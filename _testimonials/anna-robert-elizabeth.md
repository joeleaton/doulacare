Laureen was a wonderful calm presence during the birth of our daughter. She ensured that we had the gentle water birth at home that we wanted and helped us both with preparations to achieve this. She was reassuring throughout my labour and her back massage really helped to ease each contraction. Laureen was calm and knowledgeable even when our daughter arrived before the midwife! We are so glad she was there to support us.
