I am forever very grateful for how Laureen helped me achieve this precious gift. She made me and my husband feel relaxed and made him feel empowered to make good decisions. Laureen was respectful and supportive of my choices in childbirth. She ensured that my physical needs were taken care of, such as regular drinks, changes of clothing, cleaning up, and packing bags. I can't thank her enough for the back massages when the contractions were so intense.

Laureen stayed throughout the labour, and ensured I remained calm. Her help didn't stop at childbirth, she continued to be there and help when baby wasn't feeding well, referred us to a lactation consultant, and followed through. Her support, tireless dedication and strength at this important time will never be forgotten by me and my family. She is an amazing person with such a wonderful spirit. I would recommend Laureen's doula services to anyone looking for a positive birth experience.
