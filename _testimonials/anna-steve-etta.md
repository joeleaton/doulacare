I had a very medicalised and traumatic birth with my first child, and when I became pregnant again I decided to put the birth to the back of my mind and not think about it, as it was such a long way off. At 37 weeks I started to panic and then began to look into hiring a Doula. I was fortunate that Laureen was available.

From the first meeting I felt more confident. On the day of the birth Laureen was amazing, she gave me constant encouragement and didn't leave my side once. She was able to completely understand my birth plan and make sure I stuck to it. I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, using just gas and air. I was able to have the natural calm birth I wanted. Without Laureen I am not sure this would have been possible. Thank you Laureen.
