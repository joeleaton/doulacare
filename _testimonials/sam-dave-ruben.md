Laureen taught me and my husband some great breathing techniques to help me through labour. As it turned out, the birth didn't go to plan (does it ever?) and as a result I had a difficult labour and birth without any pain relief. I totally relied on the techniques learnt from Laureen and they helped me cope with the experience. I was able to manage the pain while keeping calm and focusing on my breathing. Laureen gave me the positive tools/techniques that I needed to keep motivated during labour and I'd definitely recommend working with her.
