Thank you for supporting my wife as her doula at the birth of our fourth child. We hoped it would be a short, easy labour, as with our other children (now teenagers); but how wrong we were. Christine could not have done it without you through her long labour, which left her so weary and exhausted and ended up with a caesarean operation, as our baby would not descend due to her cord being wrapped round her neck and also there being a knot in it.

Thank you for being with her in theatre. I am so grateful you never left her side.

You went the extra mile of visiting numerous times and supporting her after the birth, when I was thousands of miles away, with nobody to cheer her up. Thanks for the great work.
