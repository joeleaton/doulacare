We chose to have Laureen as our doula for our second birth and once again it is one of the best decisions we have made. Laureen has been a great pillar of support throughout the birth of our baby girl. It was so great to have the extra person especially as we had a toddler to sort out before hand. Whilst my husband was dealing with my toddler Laureen stayed with me and helped me through my contractions. The constant reassurance that I am doing great from Laureen helped me get through my contractions and give birth naturally without any interventions and painkillers. I am so glad that we chose to have a doula and that being Laureen who is absolutely caring and gentle made it worth it.
