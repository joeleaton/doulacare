When my wife suggested we hired a doula I thought - brilliant! I knew I could really do with the extra pair of hands. We had used Laureen before and she met our expectations again. The antenatal sessions were helpful as they helped me with what and how I could help my wife, for example back massage and how to use the Rebozo. It was so useful that she was able to stay with my wife while I dropped off our son to my parents before going to the hospital. Labour was quicker than I expected and Laureen was great in creating a calm relaxing atmosphere and ensuring my wife was relaxed. Having Laureen helped me take part in the birthing experience and be of help to my wife. Laureen provided me with sound advice and knowledge which I was able to relay to the midwife when we had to make important decisions. I would definitely recommend having a doula to other Dads.
