Laureen came to assist me at home for a couple of weeks, soon after the birth of our baby daughter. Having the extra pair of hands around the house was invaluable and really helped my husband and I cope much better during those early days. Laureen was a great help to us. She was calm and attentive and was equally as helpful around the house, as she was with our baby daughter or toddler son. Laureen was also very reassuring with her knowledge on any questions my husband and I had regarding our young baby.
