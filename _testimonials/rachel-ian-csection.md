I want to say thank you to Laureen for being my doula. From our first meeting I knew she was the calm, strong-minded, level-headed person I would want at my birth. She has a lot of experience and I knew I was in safe hands. In the end I had an elective c section due to a previous shoulder dystocia. Laureen spoke to me of positions that might help to prevent a shoulder dystocia, and gave me information about a previous birth she attended where the mother also had a previous dystocia. However she did not pressure me to abandon my plans for a C-section. It was clear she would support me whichever option I chose. I appreciated Laureen's calm presence at my c section and would recommend her to anyone considering using a doula. Laureen's character and experience is rare and invaluable.
