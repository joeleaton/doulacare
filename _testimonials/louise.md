For my first baby, I had a medicalised birth, and nearly died from postnatal complications 2 weeks later. I realised I was going to need some extra help to get through my next pregnancy and labour, so I decided to look for a doula and found Laureen. She was so helpful, non-pressurising and confidence building in the run-up to the birth. The antenatal sessions were helpful in reminding my husband and I of how labour works, encouraging us to investigate our options for where to give birth, writing a birth plan and giving us the tools to approach labour differently this time.

At the birth I felt supported and encouraged by Laureen. It was fantastic to have someone there who completely understood and believed in my birthplan. My husband also greatly appreciated the fact that (unlike last time) he felt he could safely leave my side to take short breaks when he needed to. Our baby was born in a birthing pool with just breathing techniques and gas & air - no other pain relief or medical interventions, just as we'd hoped. We owe that in large part to Laureen's constant encouragement and timely assistance - thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

As well as being very experienced, it's worth mentioning that Laureen is also very well networked - she's familiar with the delivery suites at all the local hospitals, she knows many of the homebirth midwives and, although not a medical professional, she understands how the local healthcare system works, which is a big plus, particularly if you need to negotiate permission for a slightly, 'non standard' birth plan! She also runs the Crawley and Horsham Positive Birth Movement group, which I was able to attend antenatally, and found very helpful. I'd definitely recommend Laureen to anyone who needs a bit of extra support to get through pregnancy and labour, or anyone seeking a natural, family-centred approach to childbirth.
