When my partner suggested that we have a doula I agreed that we needed someone with us who had plenty of experience. Laureen exceeded our expectations. The antenatal sessions were really helpful. Having someone come and explain everything to us was exactly what we needed. The birth of our baby was much better than I had expected. Time went really quickly and the whole situation felt calm and under control. I was able to help my partner in many ways as Laureen had explained to me. Her experience and knowledge helped us make better decisions than we would have done if we had not been so well informed. I would definitely recommend having a doula to other Dads; in fact I have already done so. Laureen's care, knowledge and experience far outweighs her fee.
