My name is Nuno and when my wife got pregnant we decided that we where going to take Laureen's classes to help prepare us for the birth of our son Gabriel. I must say that at first I didn't think that it would make a big difference. I could not be more wrong. The classes made a huge difference. I don't think that my wife would have been able to do everything she did without Laureen's help. The classes where very thorough and like I said before, they where very helpful. We could not have done it without them. Thank you once more Laureen.
