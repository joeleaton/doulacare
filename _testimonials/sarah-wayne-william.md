Thank you Laureen for being our doula for the birth of William. During my pregnancy, I had heard many stories from friends, acquaintances, and in the media of difficult birth experiences, and so I was feeling rather nervous in the run up to labour. I knew that I wanted a third person with us to help us feel calm and safe, and to guide us through. Laureen did just that. On the day, she came to our house and was a reassuring background presence as the contractions got stronger.

Once in the hospital, I progressed quickly and ended up spending most of the labour in triage without a midwife present. It was extremely positive to have Laureen with us to ensure us that things were progressing as expected. Her presence was invaluable during the pushing stage when things became rather intense. She helped me to calm down my breathing so that I could push effectively, She then took some beautiful photos after the birth and helped me to get settled in the post-natal ward. I would recommend Laureen to add calm and reassurance to your birth.
