I am so pleased I used Laureen as my doula. It was especially important to me as a single mother and one not having family around. She took such good care of me and I did not have to worry about anything so I could concentrate on birthing my baby. Laureen also helped with pain relief using massage and rebozo. It was so good to have someone with experience around to help.
